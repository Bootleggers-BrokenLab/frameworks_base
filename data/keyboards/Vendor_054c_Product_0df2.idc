## Touchpad ##

# Because of the way this touchpad is positioned, touches around the edges are
# no more likely to be palms than ones in the middle, so remove the edge zones
# from the palm classifier to increase the usable area of the pad.

# TODO(b/351326684): Ideally "Scroll X Out Scale" and "Scroll Y Out Scale"
# should be adjusted as well. Currently not supported in IDC files.
